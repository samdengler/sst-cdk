# sst-cdk [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/sst-cdk)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sst-cdk)

sst-cdk is a lightweight fork of [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). It's used internally in [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack).

It allows SST to call specific CDK CLI methods programmatically. Instead of using the CLI.

## Versioning

Versions are kept in sync with AWS CDK releases. With additional updates released as release candidates. For example, `1.61.0-rc.4` is the 4th internal release after merging with AWS CDK `1.61.0`.
